# Lab 01

Big Data Technologies

## Objectives

* Deploy and Discuss the structure of a Spark Application
* Compare and Contrast the difference between a PySpark and Scala Spark Application
* Explain the concept of File Paths and explain how they are used to load data into a Spark Cluster

## Outcomes

At the completion of this lab you will have compiled a significant Spark application and learned of the structure of a Spark Application. You will have dealth with file paths and how to load data into a Spark Cluster (local) for Data Analysis.

### Lab 01

You are to take the sample code listed in Chapter 02, the MnMCount for both Python and Scala, in the case of Scala, you are to use the SBT tool to build and run the application (see Monday slides for info to install SBT). You will capture the entire screen of output, the key content will look something like this:

```
+-----+------+----------+
|State| Color|sum(Count)|
+-----+------+----------+
|   CA|Yellow|    100956|
|   CA| Brown|     95762|
|   CA| Green|     93505|
|   CA|   Red|     91527|
|   CA|Orange|     90311|
|   CA|  Blue|     89123|
